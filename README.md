# jp-motors

We pride ourselves in using experience and contacts built up over a combined almost 50 years in the car business to supply top quality, good value used cars, while still offering a service and repair back-up.

We aim to offer a level of personal attention greater than most garages, and are available to offer advice on any car related matter. If we donâ€™t know the answer, we probably know someone who does!

Please contact us by phone or e-mail to discuss our car finder service, details of cars currently available, or if you have a car you wish to sell.

Most of our customers come to us by personal recommendation, and we have a number of customers who have relied on us for all their motoring needs for up to 30 years, so we must be doing something right!
